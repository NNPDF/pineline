# Code Highlighting

`nextra-theme-docs` uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com) and [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)
to highlight the code blocks. This section covers how you can customize it.

## More Languages

To keep the bundle small, only a [subset of languages](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js)
are included in the syntax highlighter. If you want to add more languages, you can do the following:

1. Run `yarn add prismjs prism-react-renderer` to add dependencies to your Nextra project.
2. Add the following code to your `pages/_app.js`:

```jsx
import Prism from 'prism-react-renderer/prism'
;(typeof global !== 'undefined' ? global : window).Prism = Prism

require('prismjs/components/prism-kotlin')
require('prismjs/components/prism-csharp')
```

```toml


# This is a TOML document

title = "TOML Example"

[owner]
name = "Tom Preston-Werner"
dob = 1979-05-27T07:32:00-08:00

[database]
enabled = true
ports = [8000, 8001, 8002]
data = [["delta", "phi"], [3.14]]
temp_targets = {cpu = 79.5, case = 72.0}

[servers]

[servers.alpha]
ip = "10.0.0.1"
role = "frontend"

[servers.beta]
ip = "10.0.0.2"
role = "backend"

```

Restart your app and you will have Kotlin and C# code highlighting supported.
You can find the full list of available languages [here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/master/components).
