# Installation

Following, multiple installation methods are described. They can be installed
through Python package manager [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/).

## Basic installation

Just the basic pineline, using pre-built grids.

```sh
pip install pineline
```

## Complete installation

The full pineline, able to compute grids as well.

```sh
pip install 'pineline[full]'
```

## Third-party dependencies

There are few to none further dependencies needed for most use cases.

In particular the <InLink href="#basic-installation">Basic installation</InLink>
above provides all tools required to _compute_ a theory (starting from grids).
But there might be more operations, that even if not _strictly required_, they
are part of the normal workflow.

One of the most common one is to the test the predictions for a given
grid/FkTable, applying a known PDF set.
For this basic application, at least the [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/)
library (and Python package) is required.

### From scratch

1. Prepare a fresh environment

   ```sh
   virtualenv env
   ```

2. Download the `.sh` scripts in
   [`N3PDF/workflows/packages/lhapdf`](https://github.com/N3PDF/workflows/tree/v2/packages/lhapdf)

   > **Note:**
   > The scripts in this folder are extremely simple, and can be inspected and
   > manually typed in the shell. Here, we are referring to this folder just
   > because this scripts are maintained by (and for the convenience of) N3PDF
   > members, so `install.sh` might occasionally contain workarounds to run the
   > last (or recent enough) version of LHAPDF.

3. Export `$PREFIX` environment variable

   ```sh
   export PREFIX=$(realpath ./env)
   ```

4. Run the `install.sh` script:

   ```sh
   sh install.sh
   ```

5. (Optional) To clean up, run the `clean.sh` script:

   ```sh
   sh clean.sh
   ```

Finally, you can install `pineline` as described above, or any other Python
package as well, just using `pip`.

### Container

Another option, especially useful for automated workflows and remote
environments, it is to run inside a
[container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/), building a
suitable one ahead of time.

For the specific case of LHAPDF, a suitable
[`lhapdf`](https://github.com/N3PDF/workflows/pkgs/container/lhapdf) container
is pre-built and provided.
It can be used simply pulling it:

```sh
podman pull ghcr.io/n3pdf/lhapdf:v2
```

> A couple of other containers, containing pre-installed tools like APFEL and
> QCDNUM (specifically their Python packages/bindings), are available in the
> same repository.
