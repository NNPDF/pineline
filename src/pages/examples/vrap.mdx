# Change theory predictions in a PDF fits.

In this tutorial we are going to study the effect of a theory change in a PDF fit.
We are going to start with the NNPDF4.0 NNLO global fit.
While DIS observables are computed at NNLO, hadronic observables are instead computed
at NLO and then multiplied by a k-factor for the NNLO contribution.

In order to include NNLO contributions for a given observable we will need to produce grids at the desired order for each observable.
In particular we choose one of the Fixed-Target Drell-Yan datasets (E605).
We need to find a Monte Carlo generator able to produce NNLO predictions _and_ `pineappl` grids[^1].
Then the generator is interfaced to `pinefarm` in order to ensure the theory settings
are compatible with the rest of the 4.0 dataset.

After the grids are generated, we transform them into FastKernel tables so that they can be used as part of a fit.
At the end we outline the steps necessary in order to make the predictions available to the NNPDF fitting framework[^2].

In principle the tutorial should be easy to follow with minimal knowledge of `python`
and a `>3.9` installation.

## Grid generation
Since our goal is to study the impact of the NNLO contribution to a particular cross-section,
it is necessary to choose an appropriate parton-level fixed-order generator.
For this exercise we have chosen [`vrap`](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~lance/Vrap/)[^3].
which is able to compute Drell-Yan at NNLO with fixed-target kinematics.

In order to be able to produce grids with it, we have modified the original `vrap`
to also output `pineappl` grids after the calculation of a cross-section.
We have dubbed this "vrap with pineappl" with the tongue-in-cheek name of [Hawaiian Vrap](https://github.com/NNPDF/hawaiian_vrap).

> **_NOTE:_** An example of usage for `hawaiian vrap` can be found [here](https://github.com/NNPDF/hawaiian_vrap/tree/main/NNPDFCards).

Once we have a MC generator ready, we can implement it as part of `pinefarm` and, once we do, we can use it to generate as many new theory predictions for different observables as want!

### 1. Prepare a development installation of `pinefarm`
The `hawaiian vrap` interface in `pinefarm` is [available](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinefarm/blob/main/src/pinefarm/external/vrap.py) in github,
with a few extra points (for instance, it is also used to generate positivity observables).
In this section we will go only through the essential aspects of implementing a new program in `pinefarm` in order to generate the predictions at NNLO for E605.

The first step is to clone the `pinefarm` repository and install it in developer mode.
`pinefarm`, which glues together other pieces of code, is a python code and we use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for package management and development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NNPDF/pinefarm.git
cd pinefarm
poetry shell
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Add an automatic installer
Since `pinefarm` builds up an environment with all the necessary packages, the first step is to add an installer to the `install.py` [file](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinefarm/blob/b6993605ef3ab6b5fa711f384d8fdcbf2108c8a7/src/pinefarm/install.py#L85).

The code below performs a couple of checks and then installs `hawaiian vrap`.

```python
def hawaiian_vrap():
    # Ensure that pineappl and lhapdf are installed
    _ = lhapdf()
    _ = pineappl(capi=True)

    # Use the configs module to have a generic vrap executable path
    vrapx = configs.configs["commands"]["vrap"]

    # Have a rule to check whether vrap is installed as we want
    if is_exe(vrapx):
        print("✓ Found vrap")
        return True

    # Download and instal the desired version of vrap
    url = f"https://github.com/NNPDF/hawaiian_vrap/archive/refs/tags/1.4.tar.gz"
    print(f"Installing the version {vrap.VERSION} of vrap from {url}")

    # Uncompress the downloaded vrap and install it in the prefix path set by config
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
        tmp_path = pathlib.Path(tmp)
        vrap_tar = tmp_path / f"hawaiian_vrap-{vrap.VERSION}.tar.gz"
        with requests.get(url) as r:
            vrap_tar.write_bytes(r.content)

        with tarfile.open(vrap_tar, "r:gz") as tar:
            tar.extractall(tmp_path)

        # Compile vrap
        tmp_vrap = tmp_path / f"hawaiian_vrap-{vrap.VERSION}"
        subprocess.run("autoreconf -fiv", cwd=tmp_vrap / "src", shell=True, check=True)
        build_dir = tmp_vrap / "build"
        build_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        subprocess.run(
            ["../src/configure", "--prefix", configs.configs["paths"]["prefix"]],
            cwd=build_dir,
            check=True,
        )
        subprocess.run(["make", "install"], cwd=build_dir, check=True)

    return is_exe(vrapx)
```

Once the installation is prepared, add a command line option to install it by copying one of the options [here](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinefarm/blob/b6993605ef3ab6b5fa711f384d8fdcbf2108c8a7/src/pinefarm/cli/install.py#L29).

Then, inside the `poetry shell`, one can do:
```bash
pinefarm install vrap
```

This will automatically check whether `lhapdf` and `pineappl` are available and will install them otherwise.

### 3. Write a runner for `hawaiian vrap`
There are several runners already available in the `pinefarm` for various degrees of complexity in the [external folder](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinefarm/tree/main/src/pinefarm/external).
The runner for `hawaiian vrap`, since it has to deal with a relatively simple format of runcard and only one type of process, is not very complicated.
We will go through it step by step.

#### 1. Initializer of the runner
We need to write a subclass of `pinefarm.external.interface.External`. 
Every run of `pinefarm` for a particular program starts by instantiating this class and taking a `pinecard` which defines the run (see examples [here](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinecards/) and a [theory card](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinefarm/blob/main/extras/theories/theory_200_1.yaml) which defines all theory settings. 

The instantiation of the class should read both and construct the right runcard for the target program.
In the case of `hawaiian vrap` this is straightforward since the runcard for the program is quite simple.
We will see this explicitly below.

As an example [here](https://github.com/NNPDF/hawaiian_vrap/blob/main/NNPDFCards/DYE605.dat) we have a runcard for `hawaiian vrap` to be compared with the associated [pinecard](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinecards/blob/master/DYE605/vrap.yaml), which is just a `yaml` version of the same information.

We should also read all the information from the theory runcard and fill in
the necessary parameters in the generator runcard.
In this tutorial we are going to limit ourselves to the perturbative order (`PTO`) and translate it to the notation that `vrap` uses (`LO`, `NLO`, `NNLO`).

Although the grid is PDF independent, the generator (usually) require a PDF to run.
This is given by the `pdf` attribute: `self.pdf`.
This `.pdf` will be used at the end of the run in order to check the results are correct.

```python
class Vrap(External):
    def __init__(self, pinecard, theorycard, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(pinecard, theorycard, *args, **kwargs)

        # Read and translate perturbative order
        order = theorycard.get("PTO")
        if order == 0:
            vrap_order = "LO"
        elif order == 1:
            vrap_order = "NLO"
        elif order >= 2:
            vrap_order = "NNLO"
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Order PTO={order} not understood by vrap runner")

        # It will be DYE605.dat if the name of the pinecard is DYE605
        self._kin_card = f"{self.name}*.dat")

        # Read the input card
        input_card = self.source / "vrap.yaml"
        yaml_dict = yaml.safe_load(input_card.open("r", encoding="utf-8"))
        yaml_dict["Order"] = vrap_order
        input_yaml["PDFfile"] = f"{self.pdf}.LHgrid"

        # Write down the vrap runcard
        self._input_card = (self.dest / self.name).with_suffix(".dat")
        as_lines = [f"{k} {v}" for k, v in yaml_dict.items()]
        self._input_card.write_text("\n".join(as_lines))

    def collect_versions(self):
        """Currently the version is defined by this file"""
        return {"vrap_version": "1.4"}
```

#### 2. The `run` method
Once the translation layer (through the instantiation of the class) has prepared the runcards,
the next step is to define how the code will be `run` using the `run` method of the class.
We use [`subprocess.run`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run) to run the command.
The output folder is auto-filled by `pinefarm` as the `dest` property which we use to run the command using `subprocess.run` (`cwd=self.dest`).
The `pineappl` result of `hawaiian vrap` is called `test.pineappl.lz4` so at the end we modify it to the desired name (in our case just the name of the dataset, also filled by `pinefarm`: `self.grid`).

```python
    def run(self):
        command = configs.configs["commands"]["vrap"]
        subprocess.run([command, self._input_card, self._kin_card], cwd=self.dest, check=True)

        pineappl_file = self.dest / "test.pineappl.lz4"

        # Optimize the grid 
        grid = pineappl.grid.Grid.read(pineappl_file.as_posix())
        grid.optimize()
        grid.write(self.grid)

        # Read up also the MC results for later comparison
        _, _, cv, stat = np.loadtxt(self.dest / "results.out", unpack=True)
        self._results = (cv, stat)
```

#### 3. Checking the results
At the end of every run, `pinefarm` will try to check that the results from the `pineappl` grid are compatible with the results obtained during the integration.
The class is required to fill a `pandas.DataFrame` with `result`, `error`, `sv_min` and `sv_max` using the `results` method. 
The `sv_` variables are for scale variations if the Monte Carlo generator provides numbers for a check.

```python
    def results(self):
        cv, stat_errors = self._results
        final_cv = np.sum(cv, axis=0)
        final_stat = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.power(stat_errors, 2), axis=0))

        d = {
            "result": final_cv,
            "error": final_stat,
            "sv_min": np.zeros_like(final_cv),
            "sv_max": np.zeros_like(final_cv),
        }

        return pd.DataFrame(data=d)
```

### 4. Run!

After the runner is prepared, we can now run `vrap` for any dataset by preparing the run information in the appropriate format.
There are many examples in the public [`pinecards` repository](https://github.com/NNPDF/pinecards).

Every folder in the repository is a separate ``pinecard``.
Since different programs take different inputs, the content of the folder might change from program to program.

In the generic `metadata.txt` file we include any relevant information about the observable:
```txt
description='E605 Fixed-Target Drell-Yan cross section measurement with nuclear copper target'
hepdata=10.17182/hepdata.22831/t1-t8
data_url=
nnpdf_id=DYE605
fktable_id=DYE605
x1_label=sqrt(tau)
x1_label_tex=$\sqrt(\tau)$
x1_unit=
x2_label=y
x2_label_tex=$y$
x2_unit=
y_label_tex = $s*\frac{d^2\sigma}{d\sqrt(\tau)dy}$
y_label=s*d^2sigma/dsqrt(tau)/dy
y_unit=pb GeV^2
```

Then the information necessary to run the program is given as a human (and computer) readable `.yaml` file.

```yaml
Collider: piso
E_CM: 38.8
Alphat: 0.00757002271
Q: 0
VectorBoson: Zgamma
muFoverQ: 1.0
muRoverQ: 1.0
Nf: 5
UseOtherPDF: "yes"
PDFset: 0
AlphasZ: 0.118
Order: NLO
PrintDirection: Forward
NNLO_only: "no"
RandomSeed: 22334
```

Note that some of the information on this file, such as `Order` will be rewritten by the translation layer that we have prepared in the previous steps.
Although in this example we have limited ourselves to the order of the calculation, in principle all theory-related information should be appropriately modified by the translation layer.

Finally, in the case of `hawaiian vrap` the kinematics are provided as a separate `.dat` file containing the values of Q and rapidity for the desired points.
```
7.10428  -0.2
7.30604  -0.2
7.5078  -0.2
```

Now we are ready to run:
```bash
pinefarm run pinecards/DYE605 theories/theory_200_1.yaml
````
the results will be output to the `results/DYE605-<timestamp>` folder.

## Evolution kernel operators and FKTables

In the output folder of the run one can find the runcard that have been used for the run of the Monte Carlo alongside the output results and the final `pineappl` grid.

This grid is differential in `x_1`, `x_2` and `Q^{2}`.
The PDF fit is however done at a fixed scale `Q_0`.
In order to avoid having to evolve the PDF to the process scale 
we are going to construct Evolution Kernel Operator using EKO[^4]
to instead evolve the grid down to the fitting scale `Q_0`.

In the NNPDF language the grids convoluted with an EKO are called Fast-Kernel (FK) Tables.
The program that takes `pineappl`(s) and makes it into `FKTables`
is called `pineko`.

The usage of `pineko` is straightforward thanks to the bootstrap
command including with the software.
There are detailed guides for the [set-up](../tutorials/setup) and [generation of FK Tables](../tutorials/fktable).

The following steps are those of the [FK Table](../tutorials/fktable)
so we will outline here the specific differences for our dataset.

We need a small file defining any strange operations to be done with the dataset.
This is useful when, for instance, the experimental observable is a ratio
of other quantities.
In this case however, there is nothing to modify and the `yaml` file is very simple.
```yaml
operands:
- - DYE605
operation: 'null'
target_dataset: DYE605
```

As theory card we can use the same one we used for the generation of the
grid in the previous step but we will modify the number to 600
(since theory 200 already exists).
We can then generate the EKO.

This is done with two commands.
The first one will generate the runcard for EKO while the second will create the EKO.
Although in general we will be using the default settings,
sometimes it might be useful to modify the runcard
(for instance, we might be willing to sacrifice some accuracy in exchange for smaller grids).

```
pineko theory opcards 600 DYE605
pineko theory ekos 600 DYE605
```

Finally, we can write the final FK Table:

```
pineko theory fks 600 DYE605
```

We are ready to fit!

NNPDF theories are available in the [theories repository](https://github.com/NNPDF/theories).
The layout of the repository is such that the generation of the EKOs and FK Tables should be straightforward following the steps of this tutorial.

The final FK Tables for a given theory can be downloaded using the
`vp-get` command provided by [validphys](https://docs.nnpdf.science/vp/download.html#the-vp-get-tool).

## Usage within NNPDF

Once we have the new FK Table prepared `DYE605.pineappl.lz4`, it is time to run a fit!
For this we will use the NNPDF fitting framework.

> **_NOTE:_** If you have never used the NNPDF fitting framework before please follow the [installation guide](https://docs.nnpdf.science/get-started/installation.html) and the [how to run a fit](https://docs.nnpdf.science/tutorials/run-fit.html) tutorial.

In order to use our new FK Tables for DYE605, we are going to modify one of the [theories](https://docs.nnpdf.science/theory/theoryindex.html) already available within NNPDF.
We are going to use Theory 400 which includes NNLO grids for all DIS observables and NLO grids (with k-factors for the NNLO contribution) for hadronic observables.

```bash
~$ vp-get theoryID 400
...
TheoryIDSpec(id=400, path=PosixPath('/path/to/prefix/share/NNPDF/data/theory_400'))
````

After downloading the theory, it will be uncompressed to a folder.
Inside this folder we find the `theory_400/fastkernel` subfolder, which contains all FK tables available for the theory.
Among them there is `DYE605.pineappl.lz4`.
We can substitute it with the fktable that we just created... et voilà!

If now we run an NNPDF fit with theory 400 the theory associated to DYE605 will be NNLO.
Do not forget to remove the QCD c-factor from the [fitting runcard](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/blob/master/n3fit/runcards/reproduce_nnpdf40/NNPDF40_nnlo_as_01180_1000.yml) if it is not needed anymore!
