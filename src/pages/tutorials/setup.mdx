# Set up

## Setting up _PINEKO_

In order to make _PINEKO_ ready to generate FK tables, it is necessary to set up
some folders according to the file `pineko.toml`. This file provides the paths
to all the relevant directories that _pineko_ will use.
An example of such file is:

```toml
[paths]
# inputs
ymldb = "data/yamldb"
grids = "data/grids"
theory_cards = "data/theory_cards"
operator_card_template_name = "_template.yaml"
# outputs
operator_cards = "data/operator_cards"
ekos = "data/ekos"
fktables = "data/fktables"

[paths.logs]
eko = "logs/eko"
fk = "logs/fk"
```

### Inputs

The inputs that _pineko_ needs are listed in the `#inputs` part of the
`pineko.toml` file. They are:

- The `yaml` files contained in the folder `data/yamldb`. They provide the
  mapping between the name of the FK table to be computed and the necessary
  grids.
- The `theory_cards` contained in the folder `data/theory_cards`. They provide
  the different physics parameter to be used to compute the FK table.
- The `grids` contained in the folder `data/grids/<theory_number>`, where
  `<theory_number>` is the number of the theory card that we want to use. They
  are the objects that _PINEKO_ convolutes with the _EKOs_ to produce FK tables
  and they can be computed using _PINEFARM_.
- The `template` operator card that provides some of the inputs needed by _EKO_
  and some placeholders to be filled by _PINEKO_. _PINEKO_ will look for the 
  template operator card inside the asked theory folder inside the operator
  cards folder.

An example of a rather simple `yaml` file for the dataset `HERACOMBNCEP460` is
the following

```yaml
conversion_factor: 1.0
operands:
  - - HERA_NC_225GEV_EP_SIGMARED
operation: 'null'
target_dataset: HERACOMBNCEP460
```

while an example of a **NLO** theory card is

```yaml

The operator card `template` is

```yaml
ev_op_max_order: 10
ev_op_iterations: 1
n_integration_cores: 1
backward_inversion: 'exact'
Q2grid: [50.]
interpolation_is_log: True
interpolation_polynomial_degree: 4
interpolation_xgrid:
  - 1.0e-06
  - 1.0e-05
  - 0.0001
  - 0.001
  - 0.01
  - 0.1
  - 1.0
debug_skip_non_singlet: False
debug_skip_singlet: False
```
(a more realistic template can be found <Static href="/data/setup/opcard-template.yaml">here</Static>).

For additional details about the set up of _PINEKO_ and about the different
ingredients please refer to the `prerequisites` part of the [PINEKO
documentation](https://pineko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/prerequisites.html).

### Outputs

_PINEKO_ provides three kinds of outputs:

- The `operator cards`.
- The `ekos`.
- The `FK tables`.

The `operator cards` are the runcards of _EKO_. Then, they are needed by _EKO_,
together with the `theory cards`,
to produce the `eko` operators to be convoluted with the `grids`. _PINEKO_
automatically writes the relevant `operator card` for the requested dataset and 
theory using the provided `template` and `grid`. An example of such is: 
```yaml
Q2grid:
  - 2.0
  - 120.0
  - 800.0
backward_inversion: exact
debug_skip_non_singlet: false
debug_skip_singlet: false
ev_op_iterations: 1
ev_op_max_order: 10
interpolation_is_log: true
interpolation_polynomial_degree: 4
interpolation_xgrid:
  - 1.0e-06
  - 1.0e-05
  - 0.0001
  - 0.001
  - 0.01
  - 0.1
  - 1.0
n_integration_cores: 1
targetgrid:
  - 1.0e-06
  - 2.0e-05
  - 0.0003
  - 0.004
  - 0.05
  - 0.6
  - 1.0
```
A more realistic example is the <Static href="/data/setup/opcard-HERACOMBNCEP460.yaml">runcard for the dataset `HERACOMBNCEP460`</Static>.


The `ekos` are the operators produced by _EKO_ that provide the evolution of the
grid. For more informations about the `eko` operators please refer to the [EKO
documentation](https://eko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The `FK tables` are the final product of _PINEKO_ while the `ekos` and `operator cards`
are just used internally by _PINEKO_ and thus they are usually not relevant for
the user.

### Logs

Setting up the `logs` folders is optional but can be very handy in order to spot
possible bugs and/or failures.
