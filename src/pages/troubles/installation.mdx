# Installation issues

##  Conflicting versions of Numba and Numpy

This issue is caused by a too old `pip` version, see [#25](https://github.com/NNPDF/pineline/issues/25).
E.g. this has been observed with pip v20, present in environments generated with
virtualenv v20.

##### Solution
It is actually quite simple, described in this [comment](https://github.com/NNPDF/pineline/issues/25#issuecomment-1432808046).
After the creation of the enviornment, and before installing the pineline,
update the inner pip version with:
```sh
pip install -U pip
```
