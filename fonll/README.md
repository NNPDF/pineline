# FONLL studies

FONLL is the most complex pineline procedure, since it involves an *advanced*
integration of the various tools, beyond the usual pipeline.

To get started run:

```sh
./bootstrap workspace
```


## Scripts

Since the configuration itself is non-trivial, a few scripts are provided to
speed up the setup of an environment suitable for these studies.

- `bootstrap`: create a whole workspace
    - creates a virtualenv
    - downloads relevant PDF sets
    - installs LHAPDF
